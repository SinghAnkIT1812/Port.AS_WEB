          <h5 class="leading-relaxed text-base">We all know about Google Assistant and Cortana desktop, they recognize the voice and perform an action according to our commands. Actually it is a part of the smart home concept. Just you have to give a voice command and the system will help you to act on it. We all use YouTube, browsers and music frequently in our day to day life. But what if you can access them only with your voice without any physical efforts. This Project manages to do it very efficiently.

          <h6 class="leading-relaxed text-base">An addictively simple game, Snake was launched, in its mobile phone avatar, in 1997 with the Nokia 6110 — you remember, the blue candy bar-shaped model with a single antenna. It followed the basic idea of an elongating reptilian creature that moved faster as it consumed more dots (food) on the screen, but died if it collided into itself.Taking Inspiration From This I Created A Game In Python</h6>

          <h7 class="leading-relaxed text-base">In simple words, “Front-End” is that part of the web, where we are experiencing the elements that can be visualized or interacted with.All that, is achieved with a mixture of HTML, CSS and JavaScript including objects like buttons, fonts, indexes, menus, notification bar, any sliders or tabs, etc. Making all these things function dynamically and to secure all the data that is laid in the Front-End objects, is when back-end comes in picture.</h7>
