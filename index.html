      </p>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">I am a Pre-final year undergraduate student actively seeking internship/Job opportunities so as to explore and expand on my technical knowledge as well as sincerely contribute to what is expected of me.Â 
My main areas of technical interest lie in Data Analysis, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Full-stack Development.
I have worked on a few mini projects on my own, other than that I like to contribute to open-source projects.
Apart from my technical abilities and interests, I am an avid reader and occasionally a Singer, and I enjoy playing Guitar.
